G01. Redundant initialization with the default value
The statement `uint256 public mintFee = 0;` in `CashManager` initializes the variable with a value of 0, whereas `uint256 public mintFee` does not initialize the variable with any value. This means that the first statement will consume more gas than the second statement when the contract is deployed because the variable is being set to a value. However, once the contract is deployed and the variable is initialized, the amount of gas consumed by the variable should be the same for both statements. 

G02. Redundant `currentEpoch` initialization
In `CashManager`'s constructor `currentEpoch` is initialized with its value(`currentEpoch = currentEpoch;`), which makes no sense, but consumes Gas for this operation.

G03. Unchecked loop index iteration consumes less Gas
In Solidity, the "i++" notation and the "unchecked { i++ }" notation both increment a variable, but they have different gas usage characteristics. Using "i++" will consume more gas than "unchecked { i++ }" because "i++" includes a safety check to ensure that the variable is not being incremented beyond its maximum value. In loops we have a limited amount of iterations (due to transaction Gas limit), so we cannot overflow uint256.

G04. Redundant payable consumer Gas
Using the `address payable` type for a variable in Solidity will consume more gas than using the `address` type because the `payable"`keyword allows the variable to receive ether, which requires additional computations to be performed on the Ethereum network.
