### Need to check for address(0), before setting the `guardian` on `CashFactory`

The Â´constructor` of the contract `CashFactory` should check if `_guardian` against `address(0)` before setting the `guardian`. There has been many  severe impacts in the past of DeFi that proves we should check constrains even when the deployer is expected to be secure/reliable.
