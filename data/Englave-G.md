G01. Redundant initialization with the default value
The statement `uint256 public mintFee = 0;` in `CashManager` initializes the variable with a value of 0, whereas `uint256 public mintFee` does not initialize the variable with any value. This means that the first statement will consume more gas than the second statement when the contract is deployed because the variable is being set to a value. However, once the contract is deployed and the variable is initialized, the amount of gas consumed by the variable should be the same for both statements. 

G02. Redundant `currentEpoch` initialization
In `CashManager`'s constructor `currentEpoch` is initialized with its value(`currentEpoch = currentEpoch;`), which makes no sense, but consumes Gas for this operation.
